        // This code is highly dependent on guaranteed message ordering. This doesn't mean that we can't handle
        // duplicate messages, it just means that we need guarantees that we'll always first see messages in order - e.g. it
        // can't be possible to see message 4 before seeing message 3, but it's okay to see message 3, then message 4,
        // followed by message 3 again.

        // FOR NEW AGGREGATES
        // ******************
        // If being created asynchronously in reaction to an event from elsewhere in the system, we need
        // the aggregate id to be 'deterministic'. This means that for the same event we're reacting to, we'd
        // always create the same aggregate id here. In such a case, the aggregate can react to an initial 'Create' command
        // by responding with an 'Already Created' exception.

        // FOR COMMANDS ON EXISTING AGGREGATES
        // ***********************************
        // If command is being sent asynchronously in reaction to an event from elsewhere in the system, we need
        // the command id to be 'deterministic'. This means that for the same event we're reacting to, we'd
        // always create the same command id here. In such a case, the command handler can recognise that the
        // command has already been handled, and ignore it without forwarding it to the aggregate.
